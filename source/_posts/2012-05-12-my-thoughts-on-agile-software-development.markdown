What does it mean to be <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_BLANK">agile</a>? The word agile implies a nimbleness and flexibility. When applied to business and software development practices, agility means having the flexibility to be ‘nimble’. Agile developers are often called code ninjas and lauded for their ability to complete seemingly complex projects in such a short time frame.

But what does that mean in practice? And how does that give an otherwise ordinary developer super powers?

The answer lies in the way you approach a project. The agile practitioner strives to have working code from day one of the project. But that does not mean the project is over. The software becomes a sort of conversation between the developer and the stakeholders in the project. Each iteration is like a call and response. The feedback loop is kept tight and changes integrated quickly.

Change can be difficult in a project. It’s often a source of frustration for developers. Changing a project after its completion date can be frustrating, especially for the developer who works for weeks or months in isolation, only to surface with a completed project that no longer meets the specifications. Or those specs have evolved over time. By integrating early and often, those growing pains that are inherent in any project don’t hurt nearly as much, and actually can be welcomed and handled with… well, agility!

On the surface, the agile methodology looks like a way of developing software, but it really gives a developer a better way to interface with clients and get things done efficiently.
